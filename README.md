# Arduino Sleep Training Clock

This Arduino project is designed to utilize a DS3231 RTC module and Liquid Crystal I2C to display the time and temperature. A push button is required to manually turn on and off the LCD. There are two programmable alarms (nap time and night time) that are used to turn on the LCD for 30 minutes.
